<h1>Please read this about page, it is very important!! :</h1>
<p>The questions are not randomly generated, but are instead sets that are already made, and hard-coded inside the website's code, and it has always been like this from the time this website was made, here's a summary of how it works:</p>
<p>Each set contains 25 questions:</p>
<p>15 are addition/subtraction, and 10 are multiplication/division(for grades 10-12), or only multiplication(for grades 5-9), for example if someone gets 15 consecutive addition questions(though really rare), he/she will still get 10 consecutive multiplication/division questions after that</p>
<p>So no one can really be lucky, I'm in grade 9 and I regularly hit 20-40 points, so if you get less than that then it isn't because you aren't lucky, but its because you have a SKILL ISSUE!</p>
<h2>So if you lose,<b>DO NOT BLAME IT ON ME</b> :D, thank you very much</h2>
