<p>The questions are not randomly generated, but are instead sets that are already made, and hard-coded inside the website's code, here's a summary of how it works:</p>
<p>Each set contains 25 questions:</p>
<p>15 are addition/subtraction, and 10 are multiplication/division(for grades 10-12), or only multiplication(for grades 5-9), for example if someone gets 15 consecutive addition questions(though really rare), he/she will still get 10 consecutive multiplication/division questions after that</p>
